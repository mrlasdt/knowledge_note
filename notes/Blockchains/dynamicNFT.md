# Dynamic NFTs

+ Static NFTs: are unique digital objects that exist on a blockchain. Every NFT can be differentiated from another through a 1-of-1 tokenID and its unique contract address
$\to$ metadata attached to them are fixed once they're minted on blockchain
$\to$ not flexible for any use cases in real life. Ex: Up level in game, real estate.

+ Dynamic NFTs: are NFTs that can change based on external conditions. 

## Intuitions
+ NFT metadata is where *the token’s name is specified, traits are assigned, and file links are placed*. **While the tokenID provides a permanent identifier for verifiable ownership**, the metadata is the essence of the NFT—housing the elements that make it useful.
