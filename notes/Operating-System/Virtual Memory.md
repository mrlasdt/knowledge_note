# Virtual Memory

## Dynamic Memory Relocation
+ Instead of relocating a program statically when it is loaded, add hardware (memory management unit) that changes addresses dynamically during every memory reference
+ Each address generated by a thread (called a virtual address) is translated in hardware to a physical address. This happens during every memory reference.
+ Results in two views of memory, called address spaces:
  + Virtual address space is what the program sees
  + Physical address space is the actual allocation of memory
