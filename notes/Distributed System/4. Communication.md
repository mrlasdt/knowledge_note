# Communication 
+ All communication in distributed systems in based on sending and receiving(low level messages).
+ Ex: Process P wants to communicate with process Q. 
    1. P builds a message in its own address space
    2. P executes a system call that causes the operating system to send the message over the network to Q.
    $\to$ Problem: when it come to large. It can cause of chaos $\to$ P should define the meaning of the bits being sent.
## THE OSI reference model
+ The OSI model is designed to allow open systems to communicate.

+ A message from A to B can be divided into manageable pieces, each of which can be solved independently of the others. Each layer have its own interface and operations that together define the service. It containts:
    + *Physical layer*: Deals with standardizing how to computers are connected and how 0s and 1s are presented.
    + *Data link layer*: Provides the means to detect and possibly correct transmission errors, as well as protocols to keep a sender and receiver in the same pace. 
    + *Network layer*: Contains the protocols for routing a message through a computer network, as well as protocols for handling congestion. 
    + *Transport layer*: Mainly contains protocols for directly supporting applications, such as those that establish reliable communication, or support real-time streaming of data (TCP/UDP)
    + *Session layer*: Provides support for sessions between applications.
    + *Presentation layer*: Prescribes how data is presented in a way that is independent of hosts on which communicating applications are running. 
    + *Application layer*: Essentially, everything else: e-mail protocols, web access protocols, file-transfer protocols, and so on. 

+ **Flow of messages** : process P wants to communicate with some remote process Q.
    1. It build a message and passes that message to the application layer. 
    2. Application layer adds a header to the front of the message and passes it to presentation layer.
    3. The presentation layer adds own header then passes to session layer. and so on ... 
    4. In the end, Physical layer transmits the message by putting it onto the physical transmission medium. 
    5. Q received message and passes it upward, wich each layer stripping off the examining its own header.

## Types of Communication
1. **Remote Procedure Call**
+ Idea behind: make a remote procedure call look as much as possible like a local one.
