# Common Table Expression(CTE)

+ A **common table expression**, or CTE is a temporary named result set created from a simple `SELECT` statement that can be used in subsequent `SELECT` statement. 
+ Each SQL CTE is like a **named query**, whose result is stored in a virtual table (a CTE to be referenced) later in the main query.
